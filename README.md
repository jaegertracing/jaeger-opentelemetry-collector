# Jaeger OpenTelemetry Collector

Experimental Jaeger OpenTelemetry Collector. This component builds on top of [OpenTelemetry-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector)
and adds support for Jaeger storage implementations. Hence this collector is able to write received data directly to storage.
